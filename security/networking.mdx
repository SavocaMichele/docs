## Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tunnel" icon="ethernet">
    A Cloudflare Tunnel is required before proceeding with the installation. This should already be set up, but if not, log in to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and navigate to `Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels` to create a new tunnel.\
    \
    This tunnel will serve as the primary gateway for all services running within the Homelab.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cloudflared LXC" icon="cloudflare">
    Before you can use Cloudflare Tunnels, a [Cloudflared LXC](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=cloudflared) container must be running on your homelab. This should already be set up, but if not, navigate to Homelab → Shell and execute the following script:

    ```bash
    bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/ct/cloudflared.sh)"
    ```

    During the installation process, you will be prompted to configure Cloudflared as a DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) proxy. It is **NOT** recommended to enable this option, as it may cause conflicts with other applications.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connecting to the tunnel" icon="network-wired">
    Once the installation is complete, you should see a new VM named `(cloudflared)`. Right-click on it and open the console to proceed with the setup.\
    \
    To connect the tunnel, return to your [Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) and navigate to `Networks → Tunnels → TUNNEL_NAME → Configure → Overview → Debian → 64-bit`. Copy the second command and paste it into the console to finalize the setup.The command should resemble the following:

    ```bash
    sudo cloudflared service install TUNNEL_KEY
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connecting a VM

To connect a VM to the tunnel, navigate to your [Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) and go to `Networks → Tunnels → TUNNEL_NAME → Configure → Public Hostname → Add a public hostname`.\
\
Here, you can create a new hostname and assign it to a specific VM. Set the `Type` to `HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP`. The `URL` should correspond to the IPv4 address and Port (mainly for gaming VMs) of the VM you want to connect.
