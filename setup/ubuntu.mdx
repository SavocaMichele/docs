<Accordion title="Prerequsites" icon="bookmark">
  Before starting the installation, ensure that the Ubuntu Server 24.04.2 LTS ISO file is available. If it is not already uploaded, you can download it from the [official Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).

  To upload the ISO file, navigate to `Homelab Server → Local (homelab) → ISO Images → Upload`.

## Setting up the VM

### Creating the VM

To create a new virtual machine, navigate to the top right corner and click on `Create VM`.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="General" icon="house">
    In the General Tab, the only required fields are the `VM ID` and the `Name`. The Name field can be set to anything you like, while the `VM ID` should be unique and between 100 and 999.999.999.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OS (Operating System)" icon="linux">
    In the OS Tab, make sure to select the ISO image that was uploaded earlier in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) Step. The `Type` of the Guest OS should be set to `Linux` and the `Version` to `6.x - 2.6 Kernel`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="System" icon="server">
    In the System Tab, the `Graphic Card` should stay on default since we're dealing with integrated graphics.\
    Since we're using a moden BIOS, the `Machine` should be set to `q35` and the `BIOS` to `OVMF (UEFI)`. Then, you will have to select the Homelabs local storage as the `EFI Storage`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Disks" icon="database">
    In the Disks Tab, you can leave everything as it is unless you want to allocate more storage to the VM. If so, you can increase the `Disk Size (GiB)` to your liking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CPU" icon="microchip">
    In the CPU Tab, set the `Cores` to the desired amount that is necessary for your use case.\
    Since we're dealing with an AM5 (Zen 4) CPU, the `Type` should be set to `x86-64-v4`. This will enable the CPU to use the latest features.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Memory" icon="memory">
    In the Memory Tab, set the `Memory (MiB)` to the desired amount that is necessary for your use case. Note, a minimum of 2048 MiB is recommended.\
    Additionally, you will want to tick the `Ballooning Device` checkbox to allow the VM to dynamically adjust its memory usage. Make sure to set the `Minimum memory (MiB)` to a lower amount than the `Memory (MiB)`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Network" icon="network-wired">
    In the Memory Tab, the default settings should be sufficient for most use cases. The `Bridge` should be set to `vmbr0` and the `Model` to `VirtIO (paravirtualized)`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Confirm" icon="circle-check">
    That concludes the setup of the VM\! Validate your selected options and click on `Finish` to create the VM.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setting up Ubuntu

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Starting the Machine" icon="terminal">
    After you created the VM, it will appear in the navigation on the left hand side with the name and ID you gave it earlier.\
    Click on the VM, then `Console → Start Now`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Install Ubuntu Server" icon="ubuntu">
    In your console you should now see `Try to install Ubuntu Server`. Hit `Enter` to start the installation.\
    If you don't do anything, the installation will start automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Type of Installation" icon="filter">
    For most purposes in the homelab, `Ubuntu Server` is recommended. It contains a curated set of packages that save you time and effort.

    You can select `Ubuntu Server (minimized)` but you might have to install additional packages for your use case, later on.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Network configuration" icon="network-wired">
    For the network configuration, you can leave everything as it is since the Sever will only run via an Ethernet connection.\
    \
    Proxy configuration is not necessary for the homelab.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mirror configuration" icon="flipboard">
    The Ubuntu Installation will automatically run a mirror location test. After it is completed, you can select Done and hit `Enter`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Disks" icon="database">
    Since we're using a virtual machine, that already has a virtual disk attached to it, you can leave the default settings on `Use an entire disk`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SSH configuration" icon="terminal">
    Make sure to tick the `Install OpenSSH server` checkbox. This will allow you to connect to the server via SSH later on.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Removing the ISO Image" icon="compact-disc">
    After the installation is completed, you will be prompted to remove the installation media. Make sure to remove the ISO image from the VM.\
    You can do so by selecting the VM in the navigation, then `Hardware → CD/DVD Drive → Remove`.

    After you removed the ISO image, go back to the console and hit `Enter` to complete the installation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Finishing up" icon="circle-check">
    Now that the installation is completed, you can log in to the server with the credentials you set up during the installation.\
    \
    The last step is to allow SSH connections to the server. You can do so by executing the command:

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow ssh
    ```

    \
    That's it\! You've successfully set up a Linux Virtual Machine within the homelab.
