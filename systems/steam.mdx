## Installing a game

To install a game, you will need to know the AppID of the game you want to install. You can find the AppID by searching for the game on the [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/). Once you have the AppID, follow these steps:

Login to the Steam User

```bash
su Steam
```

Navigate to the Steam home folder

```bash
cd /home/steam
```

Execute the pre-defined Homelab script

```bash
./install_steam_game.sh
```

## Install Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define SteamCMD executable path (adjust if needed)
STEAMCMD_PATH="/usr/games/steamcmd"

# Ensure steamcmd is installed
if [ ! -f "$STEAMCMD_PATH" ]; then
    echo "Error: SteamCMD not found at $STEAMCMD_PATH"
    exit 1
fi

# Prompt for Game ID
read -p "Enter the Steam Game ID: " GAME_ID

# Validate input
if ! [[ "$GAME_ID" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Invalid Game ID. Please enter a numeric value."
    exit 1
fi

# Prompt for Install Directory
read -p "Enter the install directory (absolute path): " INSTALL_DIR

# Ensure the directory exists or create it
mkdir -p "$INSTALL_DIR"

# Run SteamCMD to install the game
"$STEAMCMD_PATH" +login anonymous +force_install_dir "$INSTALL_DIR" +app_update "$GAME_ID" validate +quit

# Check if the installation was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Game ID $GAME_ID installed successfully in $INSTALL_DIR"
else
    echo "Error: Installation failed."
    exit 1
fi
```
